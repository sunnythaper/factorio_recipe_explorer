# Factorio Recipe Explorer

## Overview

I'm just starting out with this idea but I've really been wanting to visualize all of the recipes in Factorio (with any mods I have installed at the time) for some undetermined purpose. 

## Attempt #1
Someone on Reddit somewhere had a starter LUA script to grab recipe info from the Factorio API and I simply expanded upon that. I used some fancy REGEX to clean up the exported content and found a Network Map visualizer in the form of [Kumu.io](https://kumu.io). I plopped in the JSON file, made a bunch of edits on Kumu, and got this:
